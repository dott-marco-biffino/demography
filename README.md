# Demography

## Intro

Computation of demographic statististics and indicators for Italy from officially available sources at [GeoDemo istat.it](http://demo.istat.it/index_e.html) by  [ISTAT](https://www.istat.it/en/), the Italian National Institute of Statistics.

## Data source


From [GeoDemo istat.it](http://demo.istat.it/index_e.html) homepage one can easily access statistics sections about:

- Resident Population,
- Demographic balance,
- Resident foreingners,
- Elaborations (life tables, demographic projections, fertility tables, etc.),
- Other data (separations & divorces, marriages, live births, demographic indicators, etc.).


Each section allows access to the data on a yearly basis. Stocks are available till 2020 (1st january), flows till 2019.

After accessing a specific section, one enters the "View by single area" tab and on the sidebar he/she can find controls to select the desired geographical level and generate a table. 

The other tabs available are "View by territory" (not really intersting), "Download" and "Notes". 

For this project the most relevant tabs are "Download" and "Notes". 

From the "Download" tab one can access many different files (zipped csv format) with different level of geographic aggregation. 

In the "Notes" tab one can find definitions and some metadata.
